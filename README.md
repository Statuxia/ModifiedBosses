A plugin for the RevolutionWorlds off-season in which I created raid bosses for group battles.

This plugin has:
- The Ender Dragon, which now has much more HP and new abilities
- Jelu, Devil's Bane, which is a reference to the character of the same name from HOMM3, but within the context of the plugin is a skeleton with special abilities.
- There are also various new items such as talismans that give an infinite potion effect.
